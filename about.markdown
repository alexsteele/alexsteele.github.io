I am a software engineer and programmer in the Seattle area.

I work mostly on cloud and infra type stuff.

I love music, athletics, the outdoors, and keeping up with technology.

I am a pretty hardcore LLM user. I think they are exciting tools but don't know
how they will pan out yet. I think it's unlikely LLMs will lead to
superintelligent genAI but could be wrong.
